# cat-and-dog-machine
This repository provides code and solutions for a cat-dog generator which is an example of Experience Learning algorithms. The  cat-dog generator and the experience learning are realized by python program (catdoggenerator.py, experience_chain.py,respectively).These are meant to exhibit the advantages of experiential learning. Before that, the experience learning must have the basis of cat and dog image recognition, so the cat and dog recognition model must be trained first (The programs training.py input_data.py and model.py are used to train a cat/dog recognition model, test.py employs the model to discern.)
The training dataset and the trained model for this project can be accessed through the following link.
